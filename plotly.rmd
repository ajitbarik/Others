I came across this awesome package "plotly" which can be used create interactive plots with only line of codes.

This package is not available in CRAN so you need to download it from github as "plotly" is in beta.


```{r}
library(plotly)
set.seed(100)
d <- diamonds[sample(nrow(diamonds), 1000), ]
plot_ly(d, x = carat, y = price, text = paste("Clarity: ", clarity),
        mode = "markers", color = carat, size = carat)
```

### Overlaid histograms
```{r}

plot_ly(x = rnorm(500), opacity = 0.6, type = "histogram") %>%
  add_trace(x = rnorm(500)+1) %>%
  layout(barmode="overlay")
```

### Polar scatter Chart
```{r}
p <- plot_ly(plotly::hobbs, r = r, t = t, color = nms, opacity = 0.7, mode = "markers")
layout(p, title = "Hobbs-Pearson Trials", plot_bgcolor = toRGB("grey90"))
```

These are few example plots that you can make using "plotly", for more visit <https://plot.ly/feed/>
